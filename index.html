        <H1>WELCOME TO PROJECT MEIHEM</H1>
        <P>
            Project Meihem is dedicated to putting the awesome power of Chaos Energy into the hands of every-day consumers. We encourage developers to create new tools using Chaos Energy with our high-tech libraries and cutting-edge standards, such as the Web Chaos API for web browsers. We empower our users by creating standards they can trust - cross-platform methods for them to harness the power of the Chaos Emeralds that's reliable and safe.

        <h2>OUR CURRENT PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Web Chaos API</h3>
        <p>
            The Web Chaos API is our revolutionary new web API for use in web browsers! It allows you to use hardware sensors - either external or built-in to your device - to detect Chaos Emeralds and other sources of Chaos Energy. This revolutionary API is experimental, will probably be short lived, and just detects Chaos Energy for now. But with enough Chaos Emerald Research (see below), we could set up the Web Chaos API to do a multitude of things. Even in it's current state, it has the potential to be used as a tracking device for lost items, an input method for games involving movement, and much much more!

        <h3>Chaos Emerald Research</h3>
        <p>
            We're currently looking into discovering more about Chaos Energy - How much electricity does it output? What frequencies does it use? Are Chaos Emeralds radioactive? What effects does Chaos Energy have on the human body? If we can harness the power of the Emeralds properly, we might be able to use Chaos Energy for wireless charging or quick communication protocols. The possibilities are infinite! So how to we find this? By doing research and finding information already known about the Chaos Emeralds.
